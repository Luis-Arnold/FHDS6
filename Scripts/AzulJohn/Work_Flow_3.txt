Now I want to see the real Linear Regression
It turns out, that MSE is 11.6778 
it just have 5 bonus point

Then, I try to use the corss validation
with k-method for 10 fold
And it turns out kind of the same, for MSE is : 11.6396

It has only 0.04 differences

Next Steps:
- We can seeing again the cleaning and filter data
- And we can also using another model
